# Using SQL with JAVA

In this project, we explore a little bit SQL through **SQLite**

-   Creating a local SQL database
-   Connecting to an existing database
-   Adding/removing a table
-   Adding/removing data to the table
-   Searching for data (SELECT)

## DB browser for SQLite
This is a useful and powerful tool for SQL DB inspection and testing SQL commands, And it's FREE ([Home page](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)). I recommend trying your SQL commands here before adding them to your Java code.
