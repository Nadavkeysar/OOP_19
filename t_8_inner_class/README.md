# Java Inner Class
In this project, we see some examples of  **inner classes**  in java.

- We have the _SecretSociety_ class that has an inner class called _SecretMember_ 
- _SecretMember_ can access it's parents members using `SecretSociety.this.*`
- Static members and methods
- Anonymous class (`addSuperSecretMember(String new_member)`)

 The names for this project were taking from DC's [Secret Society of Super Villains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Society_of_Super_Villains)
